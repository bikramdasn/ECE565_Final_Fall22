# A Deadlock Control For Interprocess Communication Using Petri Nets

## Introduction
This project represents a petri net model to avoid race conditions including a solution for critical region and deadlock problem. Deadlock control and mutual exclusion is important for an automated system. In this project we are using a printer as an example of two processors sharing a common storage which is a part of main memory file. Petri net will be used for modeling the system to make it simple to understand the race condition and to find out the deadlock or interlock in critical state. A methodology is proposed here for mutual exclusion and to prevent the deadlock condition. We tried to improve the availability of the printer which improve the output rate of the processors. Illustrations are made to compare the performance of the processors and the printerâ€™s availability.
